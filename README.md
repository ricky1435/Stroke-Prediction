# Stroke-Prediction

**Motive:** According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This data is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Data:** The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Looked into all the features of the data and did Uni-variate and Bi-variate and Multi-variate analysis on the data in relation to Stroke. Few of the plots from the EDA can be seen in the pictures below.
